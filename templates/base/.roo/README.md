# ACF-SPARC Framework Rules (Human-Readable Optimized Version)

This directory contains the human-readable optimized version of the ACF-SPARC framework instruction set.

## Overview

This is the human-readable version of the framework rules, optimized for readability while still maintaining compression to reduce token usage. It strikes a balance between human comprehension and token efficiency.

## Compression Statistics

- **Original size**: 399,893 characters (~100,421 tokens)
- **Optimized size**: 260,042 characters (~67,126 tokens)
- **Compression ratio**: 1.54x (1.50x token reduction)
- **Compression method**: LLM-based semantic compression (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)

## Usage

This human-readable optimized version is intended for:

1. **Development and debugging** - When you need to understand agent behavior
2. **Customization reference** - When reviewing framework rules
3. **Balanced efficiency** - Reduced tokens while maintaining readability

## How Agents Load Rules

When an agent is activated:

1. It loads ALL universal rules from `rules/` directory
2. It loads its specialist-specific rules from `rules-<agent>/` directory  
3. Rules are processed in numeric order (10-, 20-, 30-, etc.)
4. Each agent only loads their specific rules (~5,000-15,000 tokens per agent)
5. The entire framework is never loaded at once

## Optimization Details

This version achieves a balance between:
- **Readability**: Maintains clear structure and explanations
- **Efficiency**: 33% token reduction from uncompressed version
- **Functionality**: 100% semantic equivalence maintained

For maximum token efficiency in production, use the minified version in `templates/minimal/.roo/` (~55,879 tokens).

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT EDIT** these files directly in your project
- **DO NOT EDIT** these optimized versions for framework development
- Framework modifications must be made in the original acf-sparc repository:
  - Edit files in the `src/` directory of the acf-sparc repo
  - Run `python minify.py` to regenerate optimized versions
  - Test changes before distribution
- These files are optimized for AI consumption with human readability
- Updates come through `npx acf-sparc init` command
- Generated by `minify.py` from the source files in `src/`

## SPARC Methodology Attribution

The SPARC methodology was derived and implemented based on the public work of [ruvnet](https://github.com/ruvnet).
