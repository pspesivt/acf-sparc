# ACF-SPARC Framework Rules (Minified Version)

This directory contains the aggressively minified version of the ACF-SPARC framework instruction set.

## Overview

This is the production-optimized version of the framework rules, compressed using advanced minification techniques to minimize token usage while maintaining 100% functionality.

## Compression Statistics

- **Original size**: 399,893 characters (~100,421 tokens)
- **Minified size**: 211,186 characters (~55,879 tokens)
- **Compression ratio**: 1.89x (1.80x token reduction)
- **Compression method**: LLM-based semantic compression (o4-mini-2025-04-16)

## Directory Structure

Same as the human-readable version:

```

```

## Usage

This minified version is intended for:

1. **Production deployments** where token efficiency is critical
2. **High-volume usage** to reduce API costs
3. **Context-limited environments** where every token counts

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT EDIT** these files - they are machine-optimized
- **NOT HUMAN-READABLE** - use templates/base/.roo/ for development reference
- **DO NOT EDIT** these minified versions for framework development
- Framework modifications must be made in the original acf-sparc repository:
  - Edit files in the `src/` directory of the acf-sparc repo
  - Run `python minify.py` to regenerate optimized versions
  - Test changes before distribution
- Generated by `minify.py` from the source files in `src/`
- Maintains 100% functional equivalence with the human-readable version
- Each agent still only loads their specific rules (~3,000-8,000 tokens per agent)

## Minification Process

The minification process:
1. Preserves all semantic meaning and instructions
2. Removes redundancy and verbose explanations
3. Compresses formatting and structure
4. Maintains rule execution order and dependencies

## SPARC Methodology Attribution

The SPARC methodology was derived and implemented based on the public work of [ruvnet](https://github.com/ruvnet).
